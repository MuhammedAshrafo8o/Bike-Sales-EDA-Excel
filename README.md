The analysis aims to uncover key insights about sales trends by country, state, gender, and product categories. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of the sales performance and highlight areas for potential growth.

## Tools and Techniques Used
- **Excel**
  - Pivot Tables
  - Formulas and Calculations
  - Conditional Formatting
  - Data Cleaning Techniques
  - Charts and Visualizations

## Key Insights
1. **Sales by Country and State**: Analyzed regional sales distribution to identify top-performing markets.
2. **Gender Analysis**: Explored differences in purchasing behavior across gender demographics.
3. **Product Analysis**: Evaluated which bike categories and products were most popular.
4. **Time-Based Trends**: Investigated sales performance over time to spot any seasonal patterns.

## Future Plans
- **Dashboard Creation**: I plan to further enhance the project by building interactive dashboards to visualize the data more effectively.
- **Deeper Analysis**: Additional metrics will be explored, including customer segmentation and detailed product performance analysis.
